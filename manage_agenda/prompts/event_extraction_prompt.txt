Extract event information from the provided text and fill in the JSON structure below.

JSON structure to fill:
{event}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract event details from the message body ('Message:') and subject ('Subject:').
2. When multiple dates are mentioned, prioritize the date of the main event being organized/announced, not dates of related events or historical references (e.g., movie release dates vs. screening discussion dates).
3. Use the reference date marked with 'Message date:' when interpreting relative dates (e.g., 'next Thursday').
4. Default timezone is CET if not specified otherwise.
5. The result must be a valid JSON with all fields and values enclosed in double quotes.
6. Replace any double or single quotes in the extracted content with single quotes (') to avoid JSON parsing errors.
7. Place the start and end times in event['start']['dateTime'] and event['end']['dateTime'] respectively.
8. For the summary, focus on the main event being announced, not background information.
9. If time is specified (e.g., '19:00h'), include it in the dateTime field along with the date.
10. Do not translate the text; keep all information in the original language.
11. Return ONLY the completed JSON structure without any additional comments or explanations.
